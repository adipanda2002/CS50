        <h3>Music and Me</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I've been an avid pianist for over 10 years now, having completed my grade 6 ABRSM classical piano exam. In fact, I would have hoped to have passed my grade 8 in September 2020 if not for the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, I've been part of two student-led bands with 5 of my friends during my time in school. One is names JWL, and the other The Beetroots, named after my mother's beetroot cutlets that we first bonded over. Together we performed at various school events, which was a great way to entertain our entire cohort. Personally, being able to play the piano is a blessing, as it is a great way to relax at the end of a long week.</p>
