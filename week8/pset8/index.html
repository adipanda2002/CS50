        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I was raised in Singapore and take an interest in Computer Science. After graduating from high school, I enlisted in the Singapore Armed Forces as part of my commitment to National Service (NS). During my free time, I explore various Computer Science courses online so as to develop my computing skills as much as possible before majoring in the subject at university. This includes courses from free websites such as freeCodeCamp, as well as paid courses on edX such as Harvard University's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. Here are some of my non-academic interests:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Soccer</li>
                <li>Music</li>
                <li>Community Service</li>
                <li>Travelling</li>
            </ul>
