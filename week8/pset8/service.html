        <h1>Service</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I've always believed that community service is one of my my most invaluable experiences. Not only does it allow you to appreciate the positives in your own life, it also enables you to positively impact the lives of other who may not be so fortunate. Here are some of my most memorable experiences serving the society:</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Riding for the Disabled Association</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The RDA works with children with disabilities to build their social skills and confidence through its unique approach involving Equine-Assisted Therapy. Initially, I served as a sidewalker, who is responsible for interacting with the rider, and comforting them if they are apprehensive about the process. Eventually, I gained sufficient experience to undergo leader training, enabling me to take on a more challenging role in the form of controlling and grooming the horses. The experience was an eye-opener, for I became more empathetic, acknowledging the impact that othersâ€™ support can have on the self-confidence of those with physical and mental disabilities.</p>

        <h3>Service Trip to Chiang Mai with Rustic Pathways</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In October 2019, I visited Chiang Mai together with a group of friends, where we first completed a Wilderness First Aid training course and then used our knowledge to provide basic medical training to residents of an isolated village of Udon Thani, Thailand. Through this experience, I was able to appreciate how fortunate I am to be living in Singapore, where we have the highest quality and access to healthcare services. It is the simple conversations and interactions with a community that allows one to truly understand their needs, their ways of living, and their perspectives on various topics. </p>

        <h3>Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Lee Ah Mooi is an old age home located very close to my school. Every Tuesday, I visited the home for anywhere between one to two hours, and interacted with the residents, talking to them about their week, and also playing games such as chess and scrabble. I even planned and executed the construction of a small garden in the patio area of the central building. It was good to see the residents of the home enjoy our meetings, especially given that most of them only seldom see their family members, and have little contact outside of their rooms.</p>
