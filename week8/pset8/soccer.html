        <h3>My Soccer Story</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Right from the first time I saw Cristiano Ronaldo dribbling past defenders in the Premier League as if they weren't there in 2005, I fell in love with both the beautiful game and the biggest soccer club in the world - Manchester United - a club that I am an ardent fan of till this day</p>
        <br>
        <p>I’ve been a part of the soccer team throughout my time in school. Soccer is a sport that requires a high level of commitment and perseverance. It is important to be very fit and regularly get some skills practice in order to be a good soccer player. A part of playing the game is the challenge of consistently making it to the first team of the school’s squad, which was a challenge I gladly undertook on numerous occasions. In fact, I am certain that I will stay in touch with the beautiful game even during my university days and beyond.</p>
